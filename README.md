DetectorActivity.java uploads an app to an android device which uses tensorflow to detect common pedestrian hazards such as humans, cats and dogs. The app outlines the pedestrians and sends a popup whenever a pedestrian is identified, as well as plays a sound to remind humans to look up while crossing road.

Tensorflow Object Detection sample code was taken from https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/object_detection/overview, which provided the basic object detection functions for our app.
